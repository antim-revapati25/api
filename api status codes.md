## üìò HTTP & API Basics

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is used to transfer data over the web.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows different systems to communicate.
- **CRUD Operations** in REST API:

| Operation | HTTP Method |
|-----------|-------------|
| Create    | POST        |
| Read      | GET         |
| Update    | PUT / PATCH |
| Delete    | DELETE      |

## üìå Real-World Examples

- `200 OK`: Data retrieved or operation completed successfully.
- `201 Created`: New user created, returns `Location` header.
- `204 No Content`: User deleted, no response body needed.
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing field in request body.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing/invalid token.
- `404 Not Found`: Requested user ID doesn't exist.
- `409 Conflict`: Email already exists.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server crashed or unknown error.

## üß™ Tools to Practice

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) ‚Äì Test and simulate API calls.
- [httpstatuses.com](https://httpstatuses.com) ‚Äì Browse all status codes.
- [MDN HTTP Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) ‚Äì Mozilla Developer Network.
